This is an Arduino project I coded when I was in my 2nd-year days in college. 
It was when we have this IT10/L subject named IT Elective 3 but I call it "Robotics" because the subject is about robots, IoT, and yes the Arduino. 

This Arduino file is the program of the device I also made myself. It is like a thing that is put in top of things anyone should not touch. 
Therefore, I named it "TouchMeNot" because this device will trigger an alarming sound if it is lift, tilt, etc., 
so this is useful in public or private places where you want your stuff to safely stay still and others to know that it is not intended to be disturbed. 
Let's say you left your personal notebook on a desk in school or office, and you do not want others to be touchy about your stuff 
especially if it contains something secret, personal, or confidential notes, just simply put the TouchMeNot device on top of that thing you want to protect. 
If someone touches the thing, let's say the notebook, the device will trigger the annoying sound because it is on top of the notebook. 
Others cannot say an excuse like they did not mean to touch the thing because the device has "DO NOT TOUCH" word on top of it to ensure visibility, 
just do not put it in a way or areas that is supposed to be open space.

If you would like to see the device, just let me know..
